Our website creates text descriptions for randomly generated memes.
 The user of our application can alter the amount of memes generated.

The APIs that we used were Microsoft Computer Vision API and 
Meme API.

You will need a password to access the Microsoft Computer Vision API.
To do so, create an Microsoft Azure account( https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/ ), 
then get the microsoft computer vision api.

Our project ended up using a different API from what we initially thought we were 
going to use and put into the proposal. The process of realizing that our initial API 
did not work realized we needed to carefully read the documentation in what the API 
can do, especially the restrictions that it has. This is something we did when looking 
for an API that would work with our project, and it helped us find an API the worked for 
us.
